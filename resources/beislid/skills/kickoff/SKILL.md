name: kickoff
description: Use when starting work on a ticket after checking out the feature branch. Fetches the ticket, explores the codebase, routes vague tickets through spec, routes large work through break-spec, then hands implementation-ready work to blueprint and implement. Adapts to whatever ticket tracker and domain tooling the environment provides — driven by `<repo>/.beislid/workflow.md`.
---

# Start Work on Ticket

Turn a checked-out feature branch into an implementation plan. Kickoff is the front door: ticket → context → spec/blueprint/breakdown → update → `implement`
**Don't use this for:** creating PRs, handling review/QA feedback, or PR handoff for completed work. Use `ready-for-review` or `review-response` for those.

Project config: `<repo>/.beislid/workflow.md` (see `workflow-md-format.md`). Probe lazily; policy-check side effects per `action-policy-protocol.md`. Output follows templates.

---

## Read workflow.md

Read `<repo>/.beislid/workflow.md`. If missing, hard-fail and stop:

> 🛑 No `workflow.md` found in `.beislid/`. If this is a fresh project, run `/setup` to create one. If you moved your config, restore it to `<repo>/.beislid/workflow.md`.

Validate line 1 is exactly `<!-- beislid-workflow: v1 -->`. If missing or wrong, hard-fail and stop; kickoff will not silently mis-parse.

When `beislid:agent_isolation` is present, load [workspace placement](../implement/workspace-placement-protocol.md) plus the current host adapter before the first repo write. Run `ensure_orchestrator_workspace`; a requested transition requires a clean source and acknowledged destination, or kickoff stops with the configured manual fallback.

Compute cache identifiers:

```bash
repo_hash=$(git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD | sort | head -c 12)
workflow_hash=$(git hash-object .beislid/workflow.md)
```

Try to read `${BEISLID_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.local/state/beislid}/probes/<repo_hash>.json`:

- Missing → empty in-memory probe state; cache state `cold`.
- `workflow_hash` mismatch → empty in-memory probe state; cache state `stale`.
- Hash matches → load capability entries; cache state `fresh`. Per-cap freshness uses `probe_cache.ttl_hours`, default 24.

Print orientation prose from `kickoff-templates.md` (≤240 chars).

On `continue this ticket` / `continue from checkpoint`, read `.beislid/checkpoints/latest.json` first. Prefer matching `kickoff_context_ready`; ask if unclear. Use as planning context; validate the live ticket first. Bad/missing pointers are non-blocking. `beislid run-ledger resume --flow kickoff --ticket-id <id> --branch <branch>` may add context but never replaces live validation or checkpoints.

For durable evidence, `probe(nopal_seam)`; on ok, best-effort `nopal ledger init --skill kickoff --flow kickoff --json`, else `beislid run-ledger init --skill kickoff --flow kickoff` (`nopal-seam-protocol.md`). Record checkpoints with the same seam's `ledger checkpoint --run-id <run_id> --flow kickoff --name kickoff_context_ready` (later checkpoints use `--name <step_name>`). Warn on ledger failure; don't block kickoff.

## Internal: probe(<cap>)

Reusable lazy-probe contract. Do not re-probe within a run; the in-memory probe state is authoritative.

1. Look up `<cap>` in memory.
2. If present, `status: ok`, and within TTL → return ok; no probe ran.
3. Else run the probe per `probe-semantics.md` for the cap kind (`mcp`, `cli`, `file`, `paste`, `skill`, `subagent`, `path`). Multi-command logical CLI caps such as `lifecycle_actions.kickoff_start` probe every configured binary for the current event once. Record the result in memory.
4. On success → return ok.
5. On failure → use the call-site-specific prose prompt from `kickoff-templates.md` with retry / proceed-this-session fallback / abort.
6. On retry → re-probe. On fallback → mark `session_skip: true`; exclude from run-end writeback. On abort → stop and do not write cache.

On clean run end, write probed/re-probed capability entries back to `<repo_hash>.json`, excluding `session_skip`. Preserve top-level fields doctor owns; orchestrators do not update `doctor_run_at`.

## Global tripwires

- `.beislid/workflow.md` is the only project config source; no legacy YAML fallback.
- Do not execute a step from memory if its aux file cannot be read.
- Ticket-source fallback means strict pasted ticket context, not blind continuation.
- No implementation starts before approved design.
- Do not treat `.beislid/checkpoints/latest.json` as the durable run ledger.
- Show and approve ticket update bodies before posting.
- Policy-check ticket/lifecycle/checkpoint side effects; `ask` requires approval, `deny` stops or prints manual fallback.
- CLI ticket updates must use `{body_file}`, never raw body interpolation.
- Lifecycle actions are configured side effects; run only supported providers and do not silently ignore failures.

## Step protocol loading

Complete steps in order. At each step entry, read the step aux file and follow it as the authoritative protocol. Do not execute a step from memory if the aux read fails; hard-fail and stop:

> 🛑 Could not read `skills/kickoff/<step-file>.md`. Kickoff cannot safely execute this step from memory; reinstall Beislið or restore the file.

Read `action-policy-protocol.md` before Step 1 side effects. Verbose mode prints aux load stamps and step exit checks when practical.

## Checklist and required outputs

1. **Ticket** — read `step-1-ticket.md`. Outputs: `ticket_id`, title, body, acceptance criteria, labels/metadata, attachments/screenshots summary, ticket-source status, lifecycle-action status.
2. **Context** — read `step-2-context.md`. Outputs: relevant files/patterns/tests/docs, domain context status, open uncertainties.
3. **Team guidance** — read `step-3-team-guidance.md`. Outputs: team config status and constraints.
4. **Readiness** — read `step-4-readiness.md`. Outputs: route to `spec` or blueprint path, with rationale.
4b. **Checkpoint** — read `step-4-checkpoint.md`. Outputs: `kickoff_context_ready` artifact/pointer status; ledger checkpoint if active.
5. **Scope** — read `step-5-scope.md`. Outputs: `scope_classification`, derived route summary, approval/split fields, and selected phase if any.
6. **Blueprint** — read `step-6-blueprint.md`. Outputs: approved design summary, expected files/modules, tests, risks/open questions.
7. **Discoveries** — read `step-7-discoveries.md`. Outputs: discovery status and any durable notes recorded.
8. **Ticket update** — read `step-8-ticket-update.md`. Outputs: update status/body and implement handoff context; ledger final checkpoint/report if active.

## Run end: write back probe cache

After Step 8 or a clean routed handoff, write in-memory probe state to `<repo_hash>.json`: update probed/re-probed entries, exclude `session_skip: true`, preserve `doctor_run_at`, update `workflow_hash`, and keep the workflow TTL. If workflow.md changed mid-run or the run aborted, do not overwrite stale state.

## Common mistakes

- Continuing without ticket context.
- Treating `knowledge_store.path` as useful alone.
- Posting ticket updates without approval.
- Dropping ticket + codebase findings + domain summary + team config between gates.

## Key principles

- Workflow.md is the source of truth.
- Lazy probes, not preflight tables.
- No blind planning.
- Blueprint before implement.
