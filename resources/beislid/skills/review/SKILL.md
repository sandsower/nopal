# Review

Review a diff against requirements and return findings. This is a primitive, not a workflow.

`review` may read files, inspect diffs, and classify findings. It must not edit files, commit, push, post comments, update tickets, create PRs, or run a fix loop. Callers decide what to do with the findings.

Use this for:
- Pre-PR local diff review from `ready-for-review`
- Ad-hoc "review my changes" requests
- Reviewing a supplied patch/diff
- A reusable review contract for `fresh-eyes`, `rinse`, and `pr-patrol` workflows

If the repo declares custom lifecycle hooks, read `../lifecycle-hooks.md` and honor any phase-boundary hooks before and after review.

Do not use this for:
- A final whole-diff pass after iterative fixes — use `fresh-eyes`
- Interactive walkthroughs of your own diff — use `walk-the-diff`
- Reviewing someone else's GitHub PR and posting comments — use `pr-patrol`
- Security-only audits — use a security audit workflow if available
- Fixing findings — return findings to the caller

If the reviewer explicitly wants a durable visual artifact for the diff, evidence, or explanation, suggest `show-me` and wait for the user to ask. Do not auto-run `show-me` from `review` in v1.

## Process

### 1. Establish the input

Accept one of:
- Caller-supplied diff/range/context
- Local git diff against a base branch
- Pasted patch/diff

If reviewing local changes and the caller did not supply a range:

```bash
git status --short
gh pr view --json baseRefName,headRefName 2>/dev/null
git merge-base HEAD main  # or master / PR base when applicable
git diff <base-sha>...HEAD --stat
git diff <base-sha>...HEAD
```

If the base is unclear, ask once.

### 2. Load requirements/context

Prefer context supplied by the caller. Otherwise look lightly for:
- `plans/*-design.md`
- `plans/*-spec.md`
- `plans/*-structure.md`
- matching `break_spec_approved`, `spec_approved`, or `blueprint_approved` latest pointer entries when the ticket uses custom artifact locations
- Ticket/issue summary if available in the conversation
- Commit messages in the review range

If no requirements are available, say so and review against general production readiness.

### 3. Use fresh eyes when available

If the host supports subagents/delegation, dispatch one reviewer with a compact review packet. Do not pass session history. Pass only:
- What was implemented
- Requirements/plan/context
- Diff/range
- Verification already run, if known
- Optional focus areas from the caller

If no subagent mechanism is available, review in the main agent and disclose that no independent reviewer was available.

### 4. Review checklist

Check:
- Correctness and likely bugs
- Requirements fit and scope creep
- Edge cases and error handling
- Test coverage and test quality
- Maintainability and architecture
- Security, privacy, and data integrity risks
- Migration/backward compatibility risks when relevant

If the caller gives focus areas, emphasize them without ignoring obvious correctness issues.

### 5. Output findings and stop

Use the output contract below. Do not fix findings. Return control to the caller.

## Review Modes

The review contract is intentionally reusable across workflows, but the primitive stays side-effect-free in every mode:

- **Standard local review** — inspect the current diff against requirements and identify correctness, test, security, maintainability, and compatibility issues.
- **Fresh-eyes reuse** — a caller may ask for a whole-diff final pass focused on cross-file consistency, config drift, stale docs, pagination/limits, unused code, baseline compatibility, and issues iterative fixes may have missed. Prefer the dedicated `fresh-eyes` skill for this posture.
- **Rinse reuse** — `rinse` may call `review`, apply user-approved fixes itself, verify, and rerun `review`. `review` never participates in the fix loop.
- **PR patrol reuse** — `pr-patrol` may fetch remote PR diffs, call this contract, ask which findings to post, and post only after approval. `review` never posts comments.
- **External reviewer reuse** — external reviewers may use the prompt template below, but must return the same contract and must not edit code or perform side effects.

## Review Contract

This is the Review report shape from `artifact-templates.md`; keep it terse and evidence-focused.

Severity semantics:
- **Critical** — must fix before PR handoff. Security, data loss, broken core behavior, or high-confidence production breakage.
- **Important** — should fix before PR handoff unless the user explicitly accepts the risk.
- **Minor** — optional improvement, polish, or low-risk test/documentation gap.

Each finding must include:
- Stable ID (`R1`, `R2`, ...)
- File/line when available
- Confidence (`high`, `medium`, `low`)
- Issue
- Evidence
- Why it matters
- Suggested fix
- Verification suggestion

Output exactly these sections:

```md
### Review Metadata
- Input: local diff / supplied diff / pasted patch
- Base: <sha/branch if known>
- Head: <sha/branch if known>
- Requirements: <source or "not available">
- Independent reviewer: yes/no

### Strengths
- ...

### Findings

#### Critical
##### R1: <short title>
- File: <path:line or unavailable>
- Confidence: high/medium/low
- Issue: ...
- Evidence: ...
- Why it matters: ...
- Suggested fix: ...
- Verification: ...

#### Important
...

#### Minor
...

### Caller Handoff
- Blocking findings: <IDs or none>
- Optional findings: <IDs or none>
- Suggested next action: ...

### Verdict
Ready to merge: Yes / With fixes / No
Reason: ...
```

If a severity bucket has no findings, write `None.` under that heading.

## Reusable Reviewer Prompt Template

Callers that orchestrate external reviewers (for example a future `rinse` using Codex/Gemini, or a PR patrol workflow reviewing remote PRs) can reuse this prompt contract:

```md
You are an independent reviewer using the review contract.

Review the supplied diff against the supplied requirements/context. Return only Beislið review output format:
- Review Metadata
- Strengths
- Findings grouped by Critical / Important / Minor
- Caller Handoff
- Verdict

Rules:
- Do not edit code.
- Do not post comments.
- Do not invent requirements.
- Prefer concrete findings with file/line evidence.
- Do not mark style-only nits as Critical or Important.
- If requirements are missing, say so and review against production readiness.

Context:
<requirements, implementation summary, verification, focus areas>

Diff:
<diff or patch>
```

## Composition rules

- `ready-for-review` may block PR creation on Critical/Important findings and may run `fresh-eyes` after the normal review loop.
- `fresh-eyes` may reuse the contract for a side-effect-free whole-diff final pass.
- `rinse` may call multiple reviewers using this contract, consolidate findings, fix, verify, and rerun.
- `pr-patrol` may fetch a PR, call this contract, ask the user which findings to post, and handle inline comments.
- `review` itself never owns those side effects.
